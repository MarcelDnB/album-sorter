# album-sorter
Python script which sorts/searches for albums from inside a folder

## HOW TO USE
- Put your favorite artists in `artists.txt`, and your favorite labels in `labels.txt`. (e.g. already in there)
- Put the directory `path` in sort folders. (e.g. already in there)    
Structure:  
···rootDir/  
···├── albumsFolder/  
······├── randomAlbum/  
······│   ├── cover.jpg  
······│   ├── song1.mp3  
······│   ├── song2.mp3  
······│   └── song3.mp3  
······├── randomAlbum2/  
······│   ├── cover.jpg  
······│   ├── song1.mp3  
······│   ├── song2.mp3  
······│   └── song3.mp3  
    
  - In the first line of `sortFolders.txt` you need to specify the **rootDir** indicated in the structure above.
  - Then you need to pass all album folders (if you have more that one)
